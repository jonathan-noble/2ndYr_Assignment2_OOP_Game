A game I made - "Grand Theft Crossy Road" - is a crossover of the two influential games I love, GTA1 + Crossy Road, is where the player IS the vehicle and tries to avoid running over pedestrians, officials (apart from zombies) and coconut trees in order to win the game!

1. The game is set on a platformer style where the obstacles and pedestrians(footsloggers) are already set on or before the screen
2. Player positioned from the bottom centre 
3. Player must avoid the obstacles by trying to use the mouse controls and space bar to gear up
4. Once obstacles hit the player, the game is reset to the beginning
5. Highest score is recorded on the current levels played

## Features to look out for
1. Every time a gear changes, the speed and magnitude of the vehicle goes up!
2. A HUD with: 
a) Money (reward) collected SO EACH SCORE IS RECORDED IN THE LEADERBOARD
b) Gas, speed and gear is shown
c) 3-star wanted levels fluctuate every time the player runs over a footslogger
3. Game
a) When gardas are hit, the wanted level goes up higher
b) When the zombies are hit, the wanted level goes down
c) Obstacle (trees) slow you down so avoid them!
d) High Score is also recorded
4. Menu - Info
5. Own sound produced is used in game


### Observations on the specifications of the requirements in order to ensure game's smooth process
* Camera mode:
  1. The game is in 3D - meaning the player (vehicle) and obstacles contains the x, y and z coordinates
  2. The game is in top down perspective
* The mechanics of the levels of the game must be either:
  1. The player must reach the gem at the end of the game without getting hit by anything
  2. Use space bar to accelerate, mouse to steer up
  3. Possible bonus points for hitting a zombie
* Challenge
  2. Timer is recorded for shortest duration of obstacle done (to encourage challenge within self and other peers)
* Current score is recorded PER OBSTACLE PASSED in the leaderboard
* Possible list of levels able to be unlocked after finishing one
