A game I made - "Grand Theft Crossy Road" - is a crossover of the two influential games I love, GTA1 + Crossy Road, is where the player IS the vehicle and tries to avoid running over pedestrians, officials (apart from zombies) and coconut trees in order to win the game!

1. The game is set on a platformer style/ top down perspective where the obstacles and pedestrians(footsloggers) are already set on and before the screen
2. GTA1 Speeder, the Player is positioned from the bottom centre 
3. Player must dodge the footsloggers and the obstacles by using the mouse cursor and space bar to accelerate and aggresively gear up.
   KEY WORD: PATIENCE.
4. Highest score IS recorded in the LEADERBOARD

## Features to look out for
1) Gear of the Player is changed sequentially from Neutral to Gear 6 and eventually overheats (which spices up the game!)
2. A HUD with: 
a) Quid/Gear Change pops out beside the player for every change in gear and money collection taken
b) Gas, quid, gear, speed and FPS is shown on the top and bottom of the screen respectively
c) 3-star wanted levels fluctuate every time the player runs over a footslogger at the top-right of the screen
d) Credit from 1 to 0 when player hits spacebar, just like a classic arcade game
3. Game
a) When the Gardais/pedestrians/Trump are bumped, the wanted level goes up higher and their head terrifyingly turns red
b) When the zombies are hit, the wanted level goes down
c) When the bottom of the edge is hit, the guards and their vehicle arrives to catch you
d) Aesthetically made coconut trees (obstacles) to slow you down - avoid them ASAP!
e) The self-made attempt of coconut trees from top-down perspective
4. Menu - Instruction on how the game works and its wonderful background design
5. Shooting Star by The Bag Raiders is procedurally made using FL Studio 12
